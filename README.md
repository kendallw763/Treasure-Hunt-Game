Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project, I have applied the concepts necessary to utilize neural networks, reinforcement learning, and Q-algorithms to train the pirate agent using Python. I have designed the code for a pathfinding intelligent agent. Specifically, I have designed some code for a pirate non-player character (NPC) that is part of a larger treasure hunt video game. These are just two files out of four. The pirate will need to navigate the game world, consisting of different pathways and obstacles, to find the treasure. The pirate agentâ€™s goal is to find the treasure before the human player.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
