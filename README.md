Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project, I have applied the concepts necessary to utilize neural networks, reinforcement learning, and Q-algorithms to train the pirate agent using Python. I have designed the code for a pathfinding intelligent agent. Specifically, I have designed some code for a pirate non-player character (NPC) that is part of a larger treasure hunt video game. These are just two files out of four. The pirate will need to navigate the game world, consisting of different pathways and obstacles, to find the treasure. The pirate agentâ€™s goal is to find the treasure before the human player.

As a computer scientist it is our duty to solve problems, collaborate, and create new solutions to real world problems. A computer scientist has the ability to transform concepts into reality using tools such as programming languages, databases management, communnication, and sprint planning. Of course there are a lot more skills. These are the tip of the ice berg. 

I approach problems as a computer scienentist by using the software development lifecycle principles. I analyze what the application or project needs along with gathering requirements and build planning. Next I will start my design and prototype work to include but not limited to pseudocode. Following that, I code the problem based on the pre written code written in plain english. This will make the coding phawse easier. Of course with good software there come test. I test the code for performence and speed. After everything is successfully pushed through. The prject will be deployed. Every well though out website requires someone to maintin them. My last part of my approach is to oversee any issues after deployment.

My ethical responsabilies to the end users and co workers are information security and to provide value whenever possible.
